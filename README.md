# Mini Practice Projects
Welcome to my repository of mini projects! This collection showcases my journey through the fascinating realms of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science. Each project represents a stepping stone in my learning process, filled with experimentation, discovery, and growth.

While I refer to these as "mini projects," they are more than just code snippets; they are reflections of my evolving understanding and passion for these cutting-edge technologies. Youâ€™ll find a variety of notebooks that, while perhaps not perfectly structured, are rich with insights and learning experiences.

These transparent and unmodified notebooks serve as a testament to my dedication and curiosity in the field. They capture the essence of my exploration and the challenges I faced along the way.
